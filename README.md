Audio Emotion Recognition

The study of music and emotion seeks to understand the psychological relationship between music and its effect on humans. Rapid growth of digital music data in the Internet during recent years has led to increase of user demands for search based on different types of Meta data. One kind of Meta data that is focused in this project is the emotion or mood of music/audio. The basic classification of emotions considered in this project are happiness, sadness, angry, fear, disgust, surprised. An ML model is constructed for the project. A dataset that is manually annotated by an expert is used so that the ML model is close to real world representation. After extracting features from music/audio files using signal processing libraries (Librosa) the prepared dataset is split into training and testing part. The ML model is trained on this training dataset to give accurate results. The model is then tested on a audio/music song to recognize the emotion in it.

Models Used In This Project:CNN, MLP, SVM

Datasets Used:To recognize emotion from speech using the librosa and sklearn libraries, the TESS and RAVDESS datasets were used. These datasets were obtained from Kaggle.
